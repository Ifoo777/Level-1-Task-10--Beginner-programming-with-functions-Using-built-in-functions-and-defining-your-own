# Level-1-Task-10--Beginner-programming-with-functions-Using-built-in-functions-and-defining-your-own

##Task 1

Follow these steps:

● Note: For this task you will need to create an HTML file to get input from a user. If you need a refresher on how to do this, go back to the example.js and index.html files in your Task 2 folder for a refresher.

● Create a new JavaScript file in this folder called numberManipulation.js

● Write a program that starts by asking the user to input 10 numbers (these can be a combination of whole numbers and decimals). Store these numbers in a list.

● Find the total of all the numbers and log the result to the console.

● Find the index of the maximum and log the result to the console.

● Find the index of the minimum and log the result to the console.

● Calculate the average of the numbers and round off to 2 decimal places. Log the result to the console.

● Find the median number and log the result to the console.

##Task 2
Follow these steps:

● Note: For this task you will need to create an HTML file to get input from a user.

● Create a JavaScript file called wordManipulation.js in this folder.

● Write a program that starts by asking the user to input a word.

● The program should log the following manipulations to the console:

o The word where every second character is replaced with a ’!’.

o The word reversed.

o The word where every 6th letter is uppercase.

o An array of the ascii values for each character in the word.

##Task 3
Follow these steps:

● Note: For this task you will need to create an HTML file to get input from a user.

● Create a JavaScript file called calculator.js in this folder.

● You are going to create a calculator that can do a calculation on any two numbers you give it.

● You will need to create four functions:

● add — This function will add the two numbers together.

● subtract — This function will subtract the second number from the first number.

● multiply — This function will multiply the two numbers together.

● divide — This function will divide the first number by the second number.

● Your calculator should ask the user to input the first number, the second number and what operation they would like to perform on those numbers.

● The program should then log the calculation and the total to the console. For example if the user inputs 6, 7 and multiply, the output would be: 6 x 7 = 42
